Emphasizes the extensibility (e.g., VS Code) and focus on LLMs for chat, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration.
### Project Goals
#### **A software project using Microsoft stack to host a local LLM as a private API endpoint for the private AI agents **

These are core functionalities targeted in the project.

**1. Local LLM Hosting & Private API Endpoints**
- Essential to host the LLM (like PHI-3) locally and expose it as a private API endpoint, as this is the core purpose of the project.
  
**2. Efficient Model Management & Optimization**
- Model optimization (e.g., quantization, scalable infrastructure) is critical to keep performance high on limited hardware.

**3. Orchestration & Integration with .NET Aspire**
- Using .NET Aspire can provide strong orchestration, ensuring smooth operation, simplified integration, and robust tooling for agent workflows.

**4. Microsoft Semantic Kernel for Agent Creation**
- Using Microsoft Semantic Kernel will help with building the AI agent framework, allowing for the creation of prompt pipelines, memory management, and agent behavior.

**5. Memory Management for RAG Setup**
- Using Microsoft Kernel memory for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can support local document storage and retrieval, providing context and grounding responses in a personalized way.

**6. API Management and Customization**
- Rate limiting, authentication, and request logging are essential for managing and securing the API endpoint.

**7. Basic Logging and Monitoring Dashboard**
-A monitoring dashboard for tracking request logs, response times, and resource usage will help ensure the model’s health and performance.

### Nice-to-Have Features
These features enhance user experience, efficiency, and customization but aren’t immediately necessary.

**1. VSCode Extension for Coding Assistance**
- A VSCode extension for autocompletion or automated coding guidance could streamline the development process for both you and your users.

**2. Extensibility for Plugins and Custom Functions**
- Allowing custom plugins or functions within the AI agent setup could significantly enhance usability, especially for those needing domain-specific tools.

**3. Fine-Tuning and Customization Interface**
- Providing an interface for fine-tuning the model or adapting it to specific contexts would make the solution more flexible and user-focused.

**4.Advanced Caching Mechanisms**
- Implementing caching for frequent requests can reduce latency and optimize resource use.

**5.Auto-Scaling Mechanism for Demand Peaks**
- Although a private endpoint may not always need it, auto-scaling can help when resource demands spike, especially for users on shared or constrained hardware.

**6. Model Version Control**
- Tracking different versions of the model and allowing easy rollbacks adds an extra layer of control, especially useful if updates introduce bugs or regressions.

### Optional Features
These would be valuable additions but aren’t necessary in the initial phases.

**1. Federated Learning Capabilities**

- Federated learning would allow incremental, privacy-preserving model updates based on user data. This could be useful long-term but isn’t essential initially.
  
**2. Energy Efficiency Monitoring**

- Tracking energy usage metrics is beneficial for eco-conscious users, though it could be introduced after core performance and usability features are in place.
  
**3. Integration with Other AI Tools and Services**

- Integrations with third-party tools or services (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS) for specialized use cases could be an expansion area if your user base needs these external connections.
  
**4. Quick Setup & Enhanced Documentation**

- While basic documentation is essential, enhanced guides for beginner users could be added later as more features are added.
  
**5. AI Performance Metrics Dashboard**

- A real-time performance dashboard would give insights into latency, memory usage, and system performance. This can be valuable for power users but may not be crucial for all users initially.

### Functional Requirements
**1. Local LLM Hosting**

- The system must host a large language model (LLM) like PHI-3 locally, enabling users to interact with it without external dependencies.
- The hosted model must be accessible as a private API endpoint for secure internal or local use.
  
**2. API Management and Customization**

- The system must allow customizable API endpoints with settings for rate limiting, authentication, and access control.
- The API should log requests, response times, and usage metrics for monitoring purposes.
  
**3. Orchestration & Integration with .NET Aspire**

- The system must use .NET Aspire to orchestrate workflows, manage processes, and simplify integration with other services and tools.
  
**4. Agent Creation with Microsoft Semantic Kernel**

- The system must leverage the Microsoft Semantic Kernel to create AI agents, with functionality for prompt engineering, pipelines, and behavior customization.

**5. Memory Management for RAG Setup**

- The system must include memory management capabilities, allowing the LLM to recall and use prior interactions or documents for context-based responses.
- The system should provide a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup, using stored documents for grounded and contextual answers.

**6. Basic VSCode Extension**

- A VSCode extension must offer code autocompletion, code generation, and debugging hints, specifically aiding development within the project.

**7. Fine-Tuning and Customization**

- The system must allow users to fine-tune the LLM model for specific tasks or domains via a simple interface.
- Fine-tuning options must be accessible locally to maintain data privacy.

**8. User Authentication and Authorization**

- The system must provide secure authentication to access the API endpoint.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to manage permissions for different users or user groups.

**9. Caching Mechanism**

- The system must cache frequently requested responses to reduce latency and improve response time.
- Cache management options, such as expiration settings and manual invalidation, should be available.

**10. Monitoring and Logging**

- A monitoring dashboard must be available, displaying key metrics like request logs, response latency, error rates, and CPU/memory usage.
- Logs should be accessible and exportable for auditing or debugging purposes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**1. Performance**

- The LLM’s response time should be optimized for minimal latency, with targets for sub-second response times on hardware that meets recommended specifications.
- The system should support multiple concurrent requests efficiently without degradation in performance.

**2. Scalability**

- The system should handle variable loads by scaling resources dynamically (if needed), particularly under heavy request loads.
- The architecture should allow for modular scaling, such as the addition of GPUs or additional compute resources as the user base or demands increase.

**3. Reliability and Availability**

- The API endpoint must be available 99.9% of the time, with automatic recovery mechanisms in case of failures.
- The system should implement fallback mechanisms for memory or RAG failures, ensuring continuity of basic functions even when certain features are temporarily unavailable.

**4. Security and Privacy**

- All data interactions must be secured with encryption (e.g., HTTPS for API requests, AES for stored data).
- The system must comply with data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR) to ensure user data protection, especially during model fine-tuning.
- Authentication tokens and other sensitive information should be securely stored and rotated periodically.

**5. Usability**

- The system should provide a simple user interface for model configuration, fine-tuning, and monitoring.
- The setup and onboarding process should be easy to follow, with detailed documentation and guides.
- The VSCode extension should be intuitive and support rapid development workflows with minimal configuration.

**6. Extensibility**

- The system should allow integration of third-party plugins or custom functions for specialized tasks.
- API endpoints should be designed in a way that allows future additions or modifications without major changes to the core system.

**7. Maintainability**

**10. Version Control and Rollback**

- Users should be able to manage different model versions and roll back to previous configurations as needed.
- Model updates or upgrades should follow a safe deployment mechanism, allowing users to test new versions before committing fully.
